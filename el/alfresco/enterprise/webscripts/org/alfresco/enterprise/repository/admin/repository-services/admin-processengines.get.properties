processengines.intro-text=Alfresco workflows run on an embedded Activiti workflow engine. In previous versions of Alfresco, a jBPM workflow engine was used, and is still shipped as part of Alfresco, but it is recommended that you use the Activiti workflow engine for all new workflows. In a new Alfresco installation, jBPM is disabled by default. You can enable it if you have existing, migrated jBPM workflows.
