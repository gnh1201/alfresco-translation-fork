clustering-test.intro-text=Cluster validation performs a check to ensure the cluster communcations are working correctly. All cluster members should show success status for a cluster to be considered validated. If one server fails in a two-server cluster, then both will be marked as having failed. Failure usually indicates network connectivity issues between the failing servers.
