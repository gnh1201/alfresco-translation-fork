syncsettings.settings=Nastaven\u00ed synchronizace
syncsettings.sync-on-startup=Synchronizace p\u0159i spu\u0161t\u011bn\u00ed
syncsettings.sync-on-startup.description=Select to run synchronization on system startup. This ensures that when user registries are first configured, the bulk of the synchronization work is done on server startup, rather than on the first login. 
syncsettings.sync-missing-people=Sync When Missing People Login
syncsettings.sync-missing-people.description=Select to run synchronization when a user is successfully authenticated who does not yet exist in Alfresco.

syncsettings.logging-interval=Logging Interval
syncsettings.logging-interval.description=The number of user or group entries processed during synchronization before progress is logged at INFO level. This requires the following default entry in log4j.properties\: log4j.logger.org.alfresco.repo.security.sync\=info. The default is 100.
syncsettings.auto-create-people=Auto Create People On Login
syncsettings.auto-create-people.description=If selected, then a user with default properties is created whenever a user who does not yet exist in Alfresco is successfully authenticated, but is not found in synchronization. If not selected this allows you to restrict Alfresco to a subset of those users who could be authenticated by LDAP, and only those created by synchronization are allowed to log in. You can control the set of users in this more restricted set by overriding the user query properties of the LDAP authentication subsystem.
syncsettings.sync-changes-only=Synchronizace pouze zm\u011bny
syncsettings.sync-changes-only.description=Select to run differential sync, deselect to run full sync. Regardless of this setting a differential sync may still be triggered when a user is successfully authenticated who does not yet exist in Alfresco.
syncsettings.import-cron-expression=Import CRON Expression
syncsettings.import-cron-expression.description=Specifies a cron expression which defines when the scheduled synchronization job should run. By default this is every 24 hours at midnight.
